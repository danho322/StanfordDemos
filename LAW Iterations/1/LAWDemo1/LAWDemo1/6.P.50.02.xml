Unfortunately, heavy traffic blocked the roads, so our taxi took much longer than usual to get there. As a result, we missed our flight! The next flight that the agent put us on was delayed by an hour. At last, we boarded the plane. But then we encountered another obstacle! A big lighting storm hovered over the area and prevented us from leaving for another hour. When we finally reached home, Mom sighed and said that next time we visit Aunt Sophie, we will take the train."/>
