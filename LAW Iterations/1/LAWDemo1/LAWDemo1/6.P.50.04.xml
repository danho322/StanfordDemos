        <Chunk family="18,EpgySerif,Plain" text=" My family had chosen to dine at a cozy restaurant where the locals ate. Since I could not read the Italian menu, I randomly chose a pasta dish. My dish arrived with spaghetti, mussels, and tomato sauce. It looked delicious, but it was missing the Parmesan cheese. I asked the waiter to bring some. The waiter was obviously offended by my request. &quot;You have seafood in your pasta! You do not eat seafood with cheese! Never!&quot; he exclaimed. Then, he briskly walked away. Finally, the chef came to our table. He explained that, if I wanted, I could have cheese but Italians think it ruins this kind of pasta. The next time we went out to dinner, you can bet that I thought twice before asking for cheese!"/>
