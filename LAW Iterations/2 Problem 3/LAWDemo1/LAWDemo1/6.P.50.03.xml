        <Chunk family="18,EpgySerif,Plain" text=" I had to deliver a how-to demonstration as a school project. So, I was showing my classmates how to make a delicious cheesecake. First, I measured out all the dry ingredients and put them in a mixing bowl. Next, I added other ingredients, including cream cheese and eggs. Then, I plugged the electric beater into the wall, but one of the parts was missing. As soon as I turned on the beater, globs of cheesecake batter soared through the air. Batter landed on desks, classmates, and even my teacher's face! Everyone in the class began to laugh, including my teacher. Ever since that day my friends have called me &quot;Batter Boy&quot;."/>
