        <Chunk family="18,EpgySerif,Plain" text=" As the raft floated across the small mountain lake, I held onto the fishing pole wishing I were with my friends instead of my grandpa. After what seemed like an eternity, I felt something tugging on my fishing pole. I peered down and saw an enormous rainbow trout squirming just beneath the surface of the lake. The fish felt heavy, but I managed to haul it into the boat. It flopped around until my grandpa put it in the bucket. When we returned home, my grandma grilled our delicious, fresh trout for dinner. It was one of the most scrumptious meals I have ever eaten because I caught the fish myself! "/>
